# Restaurant
#This is an implementation of a design I saw on twitter. It is my first time creating a website in both mobile and PC view.
#I used classes for the flex. Instead of writing out the flex in each individual class, I created classes for the flex items and used directly on the html page.
This idea was inspired by Javascript Teacher on twitter. It is easier and I will be using it often.
#I learnt a lot doing this project. I earlier mentioned it was my first time creating a page with mobile and PC view. It also helped me practice grid, flex, box-shadow, and a lot more.

#CHALLENGES EXPERIENCE
I hit a road block trying to implement the map in the contact section. This help me learn about the google map api
Upon push to git, the images were not displaying. I fixed this by changing how the link to the images in my file was written.
